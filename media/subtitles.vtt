00:00:02.328 --> 00:00:04.668
Where did the creature come from?

2
00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:06.496
The hell is that thing?

3
00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:08.607
Why did it attack?

4
00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:10.964
Hey, with me! Advance together!

5
00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.221
We may never have
the answers to these burning questions.

6
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:17.296
But one thing is certain.

7
00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:20.817
If it wasn't
for the valiant actions of the Legends,

8
00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:23.860
the devastation would have been far worse.

9
00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:26.033
Buy beachfront property they said.

10
00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:27.203
And I did.

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.174
And you're living in a rib cage.

12
00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:31.002
While many fought bravely,

13
00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:34.189
it was a heroic, new Legend
who led the charge.

14
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:38.825
People of the Outlands,
you have a new champion:

15
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.310
the hero of Harris Valley,

16
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.683
the one and only, Newcastle.

17
00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:45.864
Checkmate!

18
00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:51.667
Going for a ride.

19
00:00:56.043 --> 00:00:57.915
The battle is far from over.

20
00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.197
It's go time!

21
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.408
Busted a buster.

22
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:11.753
The Legends are already enjoying
a unique and challenging new environment.

23
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.411
But that's not all...

24
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:16.184
The mysterious IMC Armories

25
00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:20.947
will reward daring adventurers
willing to brave the dangers within.

26
00:01:21.794 --> 00:01:22.676
Target down.

27
00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:34.737
Time to break some hearts.

28
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.009
Bringing the noise.

29
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.064
Walk it off, mate.

30
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.353
There's no telling
what threats lie ahead, Legends.

31
00:02:02.507 --> 00:02:03.688
I'm a diamond man.

32
00:02:03.713 --> 00:02:04.805
You won't crush me.

33
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.758
Whatever happens,
you'll need to protect each other,

34
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:09.669
and let no one fall.

35
00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:11.900
Alright. Let's finish this!

36
00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:15.777
Real heroes get back up.
